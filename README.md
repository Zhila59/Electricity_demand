# Electricity_demand
Clustering clients or time!
In this project, I studied the electricity demand from clients in Portugal, during 2013 and 2014. I used clustering techniques(K-mean model) to understand the typical usage behavior during 2013-2014.
We have plots for  each cluster that shows the number of clients and also we have a daily plot for one single client.
